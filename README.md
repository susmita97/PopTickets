# PopTickets

PopTickets is an effort in decentralizing platforms for artists or their management agencies to connect directly to their fans and sell tickets to concerts or their events while eliminating bridging platforms like Ticketmaster. Such platforms, being centralized, frequently fail in providing availability of the platform at all times and meet demands for popular events. Also, they charge service fees and ticket transfer fees which change dynamically based on demand, giving rise to scalpers and causing inconvenience to genuine fans of the artist.
